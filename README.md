# college-assignments-NaiveBayesClassifier
This is an alternative implementation of Naive Bayes Classifier in R. Even though there are many implementations
of this algorithm on internet and in most of programming languages (R has its own as well), I decided to develop
my onw using the classical Iris data set in order to get a strong understading of this method. My main goal here is 
to create an algorithm that is able to separate the class SETOSA from the other two ones. For a previous 
understanding of Naive Bayes Classifier, check this following lecture here: 
http://software.ucv.ro/~cmihaescu/ro/teaching/AIR/docs/Lab4-NaiveBayes.pdf
p.s: This is NOT a general implementation of Naive Bayes Classifier.
